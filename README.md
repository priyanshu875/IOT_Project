# An IoT-Enabled Waste Management Platform
* The smart waste management system is an innovative solution developed on the Arduino Uno platform using C++ as the chief programming language.
* It includes smart trash level sensing capabilities and an automatic lid opening facility to monitor the trash level in waste bins and reduce the need for human intervention. 
* The system also incorporates a backend server developed using NodeJS that sends real-time data to the municipality office, which can then optimize the process of waste collection using the **Traveling salesman algorithm**.
